# JLine for Minecraft Dedicated Server
![Icon](src/main/resources/assets/jline4mcdsrv/jline4mcdsrvicon.png)

A server side mod to enable command history, auto completion and syntax
highlighting on the server console. Should have zero impact on the gameplay.

This is my first mod for Minecraft. Actually this is also the first time for me
to do anything serious using Java. So please be gentle if you want to roast my
code.
